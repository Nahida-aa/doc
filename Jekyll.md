# Jekll

Jekyll is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub Pages. It's designed for building minimal, static blogs to be hosted on GitHub Pages. It's also what powers GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project's page, blog, or website from GitHub's servers for free.
